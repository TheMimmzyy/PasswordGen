*Welcome to my third homework project!*

Index.html:
In this project I did not need to alter the html at all.

Style.css:
The stylesheet also required no alteration but I did change the color of the button to purple.

Script.js:
Most all of the work I did for this project was done on this page. I began by identifying global variables such as the characters that could be used in the password. I then moved to adding the popup windows that ask all the questions allowing the user to decide the length they would like their password to be and the types of characters they would like to include. Next I created a function that would select random characters from the types the user selected. After that I created a function that would compile the chosen character types and and diplay them on screen. The last task was refactoring the code to be easier to understand and ensure that everything functioned as intended.
